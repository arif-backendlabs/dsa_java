# LinkedList


### Difference between LinkedList and Arraylist
* Inserting in arrayList(in between) or remove from any place(in between) is O(n)
* Fetching an element in arrayList has time complexity of O(1)
* arraylist memory is contiguous
* memory in linkedlist is non contiguous
* Inserting in LinkedList at start and end is O(1)
* fetching an element in LinkedList will have time complexity of O(n)

### ArrayList to be favoured when search is our main aim
### LinkedList to be favoured when storing or manipulation of data


## Basic Structure of linked List

| data |
|------|
| next |
    A Node in linked list consist of data and next. Where next is nothing but the address of next node which can be accessed from it.
